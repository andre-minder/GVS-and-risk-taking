  "TaskDescription": "This dataset includes data from two behavioral tasks: (1) the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and (2) the Game of Dice Task (GDT). They played each task 3 times (run 1-3 for each task). During each block, galvanic vestibular stimulation with different polarity (L-GVS, R-GVS, sham) was administered to the participants. A break of 5 minutes was set between the blocks.",

      "Description": "Participants inflated virtual balloons with different (unknown) breaking points to earn points, providing a measure of risk-taking."

    {
      "TaskName": "Game of Dice Task (GDT)",
      "Description": "Participants selected dice combinations with varying winning probabilities to maximize points, providing a measure of decision-making under risk."
